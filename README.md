BYOS - Build Your Own Start

This is a boilerplate for react projects. It's heavily inspired by [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate).

Why did I built yet another boilerplate? Because building a boilerplate is fun and that's how I learn about the inner working of the react boilerplates and the react ecosystem. Feel free to suggest any changes and technologies that would improve the current setting if you ever come by.
